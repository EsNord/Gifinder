tool search for Gif images
This project is a tool to search for GIF images, all you have to do to run the project is to download your project and create an .env file, then you have to create an account at https://app.scaleserp.com/
After that, add your account settings to the .env file that you created earlier, like these:
SEARCH_URL = https: //api.scaleserp.com/search?
SEARCH_KEY = YOUR_KEY
If you need see the APIs file, you can access the controller file called SearchController
And the project works with the best search algorithms because the Api calls for Google search results, and thus, the results of the priorities are no longer limited within the program itself, but globally because all people use the Google search engine.
